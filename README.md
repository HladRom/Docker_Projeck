# Docker_Projeck :star:

## Introduction
This project aims to create a Docker container that automatically configures itself to change configuration parameters upon startup using a custom configuration management system. Docker containers provide a convenient way to package, distribute, and run software in isolated environments. This project enables the automated configuration of a Docker container for quick and convenient configuration parameter changes.

## Project Objective
The main objective of this project is to create and configure a Docker container that can automatically adjust its configuration parameters upon startup. Leveraging a custom configuration management system allows for efficient utilization of containers for various deployment scenarios and provides ease of configuration management.

## Project Overview
The project includes the following stages:

Docker Image Creation: Development of a Docker image containing the software and scripts for configuration setup.

Configuration Management System Development: Development of a system that allows for automated changes to configuration parameters during container startup.

Integration with Docker: Integration of the configuration management system with Docker for automated configuration of the container upon its launch.

Testing and Validation: Checking the correctness of the configuration management system and Docker container by testing configuration parameter changes and verifying the results.

## Conclusion
Creating a Docker container that automatically configures itself to change configuration parameters upon startup using a custom configuration management system is an important step towards automating deployment and software management processes. This project provides a convenient and efficient way to manage Docker container configurations, simplifying deployment and ensuring environment consistency.
